/// 3. AND it's mutated by someone — either the enclosing function
///    updates/sets it, or at least one closure updates/sets it

/// Without boxing, each closure captures a SNAPSHOT of the value at

/// see each other's mutations. Boxing moves the storage to the heap
/// so all closures (and the enclosing function) share one cell.

/// Limitations of this analysis:
/// - We box on capture + any mutation, even if the mutation is in
///   unreachable code. That's safe (just slightly worse perf).
/// - We don't distinguish "mutated inside the closure" from "mutated
///   outside"; both imply boxing. Again, safe.
/// - Params are not boxed here because Stmt::Let handles box
///   allocation; params are handled separately at FnCtx setup time
///   (we don't box them yet — TODO if needed).
