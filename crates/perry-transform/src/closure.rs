//! Closure conversion pass

//! 3. Rewriting variable accesses to use the closure struct

    // TODO: Implement closure conversion
    // For MVP, we don't have closures yet, so this is a no-op

    // The algorithm will be:
    // 1. For each function, compute the set of free variables
    // 2. If a function has free variables, it's a closure
    // 3. Create a closure struct type with fields for each captured variable
    // 4. Rewrite the function to take the closure struct as first parameter
    // 5. Rewrite variable accesses to captured variables to use struct fields
    // 6. At closure creation sites, allocate the struct and populate it
